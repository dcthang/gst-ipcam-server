This's the brief instruction on how to fetch, build and test gstreamer-rtsp-server DemoClient. And for the testing purpose, we'll use Ubuntu 9.04 as the target OS.

I. FETCH SOURCE CODE
 - make a folder for storing source code
 - cd to that folder
 - git clone git://github.com/trungnt/gstreamer-rtsp-server.git
   The clone command will fetch source code in our release.
 - Change to gstreamer-rtsp-server folder:
   cd gstreamer-rtsp-server
 - For testing development version, using following command
   git checkout --track -b client-development origin/client-development
 - In the case that you've fetch developing code before, you don't need to checkout repository or branch from server.
Instead, run following command:
   git checkout client-development # to switch to existed server-development branch
   git pull # to update to the latest version
 
II. BUILD
 - NOTE: before building the client, go to section III to see if your system match dependences and install requirement packages if needed
 - cd to the folder "DemoClient"
 - Build :
   make
 
III. DEPENDENCIES
1. Gstreamers encoders
 ffmpeg mpeg4 and h264 encoder, these elements are: ffenc_mpeg4 and ffenc_libx264
- To get this encoder, we need to install following packages, using standard ubuntu packages would be enought:
+ gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg
+ libavcodec-unstripped-52
- You can install 2 packages at the same times if you haven't install gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg:
sudo apt-get install libavcodec-unstripped-52 gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg
- Or just install libavcodec-unstripped if gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg was installed before
sudo apt-get install libavcodec-unstripped-52
 
- After installation, using gst-inspect you may not found ffenc_mpeg4 and ffenc_libx264. This case often happened when you install gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg before with the package libavcodec. So, to use them, you must remove old gstreamer plugins registry file by this command:
rm ~/.gstreamer-0.10/registry.*.bin
NOTE: may be with older implementation of gstreamer, you file will be registry.*.xml
 
- After removing registry, gst-launch of gst-inspect will auto rebuild registry and the elements will be there
 
2. To build client, you may need to install following packages
autoconf automake pkg-config libtool build-essential gettext libglib2.0-dev libgtk2.0-dev
 
IV. RUN
 - run command
   ./DemoClient
 - Using: the client is simple, investigate and try yourself
